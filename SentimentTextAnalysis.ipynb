It’s been a long journey on the road for the Olympian whose journey touched a number of areas in Haryana where she was honoured and consoled. The rally-type journey was organised by Bajrang Punia and Vinesh’s family for the wrestler who garnered immense support as she appealed for a joint silver in the Paris Olympics.\n","\n","Vinesh began the day in tears, seeing all the support she was getting. Wellwishers and supporters shared glasses of milk, honoured her with garlands and blessings. It was around 1 am by the time she made it to her village Balali. An elaborate felicitation with song and dance awaited her here. She was honoured with a gold medal by the village elders, as they had promised a few days ago.\n","\n","She gave a moving speech to those who had waited to see her and welcome her.\n","\n","A few days ago, Vinesh posted a long message on her X account thanking her support staff for all their contributions over the past few years. She also seemingly left the door ajar on her wrestling career. Could we see a possible return from the wrestler? While she’s sure of not setting her sight on a mat anytime soon, never say never, we guess!\n","\n","It’s been a marathon of a day, but sporting action continues around the world. Catch up with it all on Sportstar.
